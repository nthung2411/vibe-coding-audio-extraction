# Audio Extraction Tool Requirements
# Note: This tool requires ffmpeg to be installed separately on your system

# Python dependencies (minimal - most work is done by ffmpeg)
# No Python packages required for basic functionality

# Optional: If you want to add GUI support later, you can add:
# PyQt5>=5.15.0
# or
# tkinter (usually comes with Python)

# For future enhancements:
# tqdm>=4.65.0  # For better progress bars
